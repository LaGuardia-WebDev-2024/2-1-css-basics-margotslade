        The <em>Sea horse</em> my favorite animal because they are the cutest
        tiny little fish with the head shape of a horse, hence the name.
        Something intersting about seahorses unlike most animals is that the
        male gives birth to thousands of babies rather than the female seahorse.
        there are at least 50 species of seahorses, with an average life span of
        1 to 5 years and the size ranging from 0.6 inches to 14 inches.
        <strong></strong>.
